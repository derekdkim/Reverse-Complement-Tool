# Reverse Complement Tool

This is a light-weight simple string match tool intended to help life scientists work with DNA, RNA, and amino acid sequences when designing primers or analyzing sequencing reads.
There are other tools out there that do the same thing but I wanted to build one to learn and for personal use.

To build up a foundation of core web development suite, only **vanilla HTML/CSS/JS** were used to develop this project.

## Features:

- Producing reverse complement of DNA or RNA sequences.
- Tidying up nucleotide sequences of spaces, numbers, and unwanted letters.

Note: Supports sequencing reads with "N" to denote unknown/undetermined nucleotides. It will remain in the sequence to prevent accidental frameshifting of your sequence.

## Planned features:

- Clean-up feature for protein sequences.
- Translate tool -- output in 3 letter or 1 letter nomenclature.
